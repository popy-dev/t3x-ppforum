
This is only a Alpha version, so many things will change (many function will be removed/moved, some hooks will be added/renamed), so reading the code is the best documentation for now.

The little list of parts which may not change
  - Forums, Topics and messages displaying functions and hooks
  - 'getCounters' functions
  - CSS selector
  - query/object caching
  - UPDATE events and their hooks
